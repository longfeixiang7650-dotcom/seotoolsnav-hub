            <p>
              NoCode Tool Hub is committed to transparency. This Affiliate Disclosure
              explains how we may earn compensation through links on our website.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#F0F4F8] mb-3">Affiliate Links</h2>
            <p>
              Some of the links on NoCode Tool Hub are affiliate links. This means that
              if you click on a link and make a purchase or sign up for a service, we may
              receive a commission at no additional cost to you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              These commissions help us maintain and improve our platform, including the
              research and content creation required to provide accurate, up-to-date tool
              comparisons.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#F0F4F8] mb-3">No Impact on Rankings</h2>
            <p>
              Our tool listings, ratings, and recommendations are never influenced by
              affiliate relationships. We evaluate tools based on publicly available
              information, user reviews, and feature comparisons — not sponsorship dollars.
              If a tool is featured on our site, it is because we believe it provides
              genuine value to our users, regardless of any affiliate relationship.
            </p>
